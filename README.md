GitHub -  is hosted, on the cloud or via the WEB to host our GIT System. Its a very diverse community where devs around the world are collaborating together within a project 
GIT - underlying system that lies on our machines 

GIT VS GitHub
- Tracks changes done any time 
- Historical backup/“snapshots”  - keeps a previous version, having the ability to revert to it if needed, or still copying and making changes on top of previous version. 
- Team based development - allows devs to work on the same code simultaneously and merge their changes together to make progress on a project
- Flexible - Locally on a project OR as part of DevOps flows (can be part of automation testing or automation build and deploy processed) 
- GIT, we interact with it using a CLI on local machine VS GitHub which is on the WEB 
- Trunk Based Development - a main code (or a trunk of a tree), from which we can branch it locally to make our changes and merge it later on. From same main code, another developer can branch on its local machine, BEFORE our merge, do its changes and merge them AFTER our merge.
