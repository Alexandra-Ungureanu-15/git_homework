# Automation Testing Academy

## Challenges Faced
During this project, I encountered several challenges:

1. **Understanding Git Commands:**
   - Initially, I had difficulty understanding and remembering the various Git commands. For example, I struggled with the difference between `git add` and `git commit`. `git add` stages changes for the next commit, while `git commit` actually records those changes in the repository's history.
   
2. **Setting Up the Environment:**
   - Setting up the local development environment to match the repository’s requirements was challenging.

## Learnings

1. **Git and Version Control:**
   - I learned how to use Git more effectively, including how to clone repositories, check commit history and manage branches. Commands like `git log` helped me understand the commit history, while `git branch -a` showed all branches.
   
2. **.gitignore Usage:**
   - I understood the importance of a `.gitignore` file and how to configure it to ignore specific files and directories. This helps in keeping the repository clean and prevents committing unnecessary files, such as temporary files or environment-specific settings.
   
3. **Repository Exploration:**
   - I became more comfortable navigating through a repository’s structure and examining different branches. This included using `git checkout` to switch between branches and `git diff` to see changes between commits or branches.

     git checkout -b feature-branch

4. **Make Your Changes:**
